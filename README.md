# About Project

## Title:
### Email Spam Analysis 

#### Project Purpose :
This project is part of my allocated project for the "TechSaksham Program (TSP) is a joint CSR initiative of Microsoft & SAP " December 2024, a one month(4 Weeks) program.I am enthusiastic about using this opportunity to build valuable skills and contribute meaningfully through this project.

#### Project Statement:
The goal of the email spam analysis project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails into two categories: spam and non-spam (ham). Spam emails are unsolicited and often include advertisements or malicious content, while non-spam emails are legitimate and relevant messages.

The project seeks to:
Identify spam emails from a large set of email data.
Improve email filtering systems by developing a model that reduces the chances of legitimate emails being marked as spam (false positives) and ensures that most spam emails are correctly detected (high true positive rate).
Enhance the user experience by reducing unwanted emails in inboxes.

#### Objectives:
Data Collection: Gather a labeled dataset of emails, each marked as either spam or non-spam.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the email text (e.g., word frequencies, presence of specific keywords, email metadata like sender, etc.).
Model Development: Train various machine learning algorithms (such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.) to classify emails.
Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Optimization: Improve the model's performance through hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or using more advanced algorithms like deep learning.

#### Outcomes:
The outcome of the email spam analysis ML project is the development of a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying emails as spam or non-spam. The model will reduce the volume of unwanted emails in inboxes by automatically flagging spam, improving email filtering systems, and minimizing false positives and negatives. Performance will be evaluated through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with the potential for further optimization and deployment in real-world email systems.
